## Description
This project will help the farmers to know about their crop before cultivating onto the agricultural field and thus help them to make the appropriate decisions. It attempts to solve the issue by building a prototype of an interactive prediction system. The results of the prediction will be made available to the farmer.We have integrated disease detection model and weather forecast feature with rent feature for farmers to rent equipment and a chatbot. Thus, for such kind of data analytics in crop prediction and providing farmers with entire crop cultivation procedure, there are different techniques or algorithms, and with the help of those algorithms we can predict crops.Random forest algorithm is used. 

* CROP PREDICTION SYSTEM USING ML : The user just has to pass some parameters and submit it. The random forest algorithm is used to predict the crop yield and neural network algorithm is used for crop recommendation to the users. The parameters passed by the user will go through the random forest algorithm and predict the crop most suitable for growth based on these parameters .
* QGIS WEB MAP STRUCTURE : This is our QGIS WEB MAP STRUCTURE with map tipping which helps to study about various parameters of crops and indirectly it helps in the crop prediction and also helps to analyze data about crops and how suitable the features like humidity , soil, temperature, rainfall impact the crop. The spatial analysis of crops is done with the help of QGIS. Geo-referencing involves assigning real-world coordinates to a number of reference points on the image. We have used geo- referencing to plot our crop data and studied it using spatial analysis for research and benefits us to yield better crops.
* PLANT DISEASE DETECTION : This feature helps the farmers identify diseases affecting their plants. This is done by allowing users to upload images of their crops (specifically, a single leaf of the plant). We have trained an ML model (stored as a .h5 file) which predicts which plant it is, whether it suffering from any disease, and which disease that is. Our model detects plant disease and helps people also know about the solutions if disease is detected.
* NEWS FEED : This feature helps the farmers to know about the latest news and recent developments about farming. They get to know about the latest farming blogs , government schemes for farmers,  latest technologies of farming etc. This news gets updated everyday and we get the latest news of farming.
* WEATHER FORECASTING : This feature helps the farmers to know about the weather forecast to help them plan their crop activity and schedule their daily tasks this helps them know about the climate , temperature well in advance to take the precautionary measures required.
* RENTING OUT FARMING EQUIPMENT : This feature helps the farmers to rent their equipment on the online portal. For this a login feature is made available which helps farmers to login and upload their equipment for rent. Other users on the portal are free to purchase the equipment.
* AGRICULTURE CHATBOT : This feature helps the farmers to type their concerns and troubles to our chatbot which takes in their concerns and gives adequate results to them based on their queries. This is a very useful tool as farmers can  get their queries verified and get solutions to their problems.

## Applications
The impact of climate change in India, most of the agricultural crops are being badly affected. Predicting the crop in advance of its production would help farmers for taking appropriate measures for marketing and storage. Implementation of such a system with an easy-to-use web based graphic user interface and the machine learning algorithm will be carried out. The results of the prediction will be made available to the farmer. Overwatering decreases fertility of the soil as well so it is very important to use water in appropriate quantity. Watering is the key in region of scarcity of water. Due to unpredictable climate conditions large quantity of crops get affected every year. So, by understanding local surrounding data farmers can save their crops. Some animals or birds can also cause damage to crop hence secure farm from them is also important task. So by finding solution to all these problems we farmers can get maximum benefit in terms of efforts as well as cost. 


## Future scope
>Mention ways in which the project can be improved and built upon in the future.
